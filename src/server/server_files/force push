 Option 2: Use the Command Line (More Control)
If you have write access to the repository, you can force merge using the command line:

bash
Copy
Edit


git checkout main        # Switch to the main branch
git pull origin main     # Get the latest changes
git merge --strategy-option theirs <branch-name>  # Force their changes
git push origin main     # Push the forced merge
